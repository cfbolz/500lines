Project: Web crawler
Requirements:
  * Python 3.4, or 3.3 + asyncio
  * aiohttp

This is a web crawler. You give it a URL and it will crawl that
website by following href links in the HTML pages.

It doesn't do anything with the crawled pages, and the algorithm for
finding links is intentionally naive -- those parts are easily
modified, and not of particular interest (just use your favorite HTML
parser instead of a regular expression).

The point of the example is to show off how to write a reasonably
complex HTTP client application using the asyncio module.  This module, originally
nicknamed Tulip, is new in the Python 3.4 standard library, based on
PEP 3156.  The module is also available from PyPI for Python 3.3, but
it doesn't work on older Python versions, since it uses the new 'yield
from' syntax that was introduced in Python 3.3.  (But don't despair; a
backport named Trollius exists on PyPI that substitutes 'yield'.)  The
example uses an HTTP client implementation for asyncio called "aiohttp",
by Andrew Svetlov, Nikolay Kim, and others.

If you are using Python 3.3, install the crawler's requirements like:

    pip install -r requirements-py33.txt

If you are using Python 3.4:

    pip install -r requirements-py34.txt

In order to be fast and efficient, the program opens multiple parallel
connections to the server and reuses connections for multiple
requests.

On Jesse's Macbook Pro (2.3GHz Intel Core i7), with a fast network
connection, it can visit all HTML pages of xkcd.com (over 1500 at the
time of writing, and growing at a rate of three per week) in under 3
seconds.  It can also scan all public pages on dropbox.com (about 2500
URLs) in under 50 seconds.

Example command line (the -q reduces log output):

    python3.4 crawl.py -q xkcd.com

Use --help to see all options.
